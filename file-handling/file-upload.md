## Overview

File upload components enable users to select and upload files from their devices to web applications. These components manage the file selection process, provide feedback during upload, and often include features like drag-and-drop interfaces, multi-file selection, and progress indicators. Effective file upload implementations consider various aspects including file type restrictions, size limitations, error handling, and responsive design to accommodate different devices and network conditions.
