## Overview

Social media link components provide access to an organization's or individual's profiles on various social platforms. These components typically display recognizable platform icons, often with hover effects, and are commonly placed in headers, footers, or contact sections. Effective social media link implementations maintain consistent styling while preserving platform brand recognition, offer appropriate hover feedback, and ensure proper spacing for touch interfaces.
