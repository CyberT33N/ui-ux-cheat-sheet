## Overview

Logo components display brand identifiers in web applications, often in headers, footers, or authentication screens. These components may include animated effects, responsive sizing, or interactive behaviors to enhance brand presence. Effective logo implementations maintain brand integrity through proper spacing, scaling, and background contrast while adapting to different contexts and device sizes throughout an application.
