## Overview

Hamburger menu animations transform the classic three-line menu icon into other symbols (typically an X) when toggled, providing visual feedback for menu state changes. These micro-animations improve user experience by clearly indicating when a mobile menu is open or closed. Effective hamburger menu animations are smooth, purposeful, and maintain good contrast and visibility throughout the transition, ensuring the icon remains recognizable during all animation states.
