## Overview

Sidebar menus provide vertical navigation systems positioned along the side of web applications. These components optimize screen real estate by allowing content to occupy the majority of the viewport while keeping navigation accessible through a compact sidebar. Sidebar menus can be fixed, expandable, collapsible, or responsive, adapting their appearance and behavior based on screen size and user interaction. They're particularly effective for applications with extensive navigation hierarchies or those requiring persistent access to navigation options.
