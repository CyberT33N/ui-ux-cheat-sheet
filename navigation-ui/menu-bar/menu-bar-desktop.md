## Overview

Desktop menu bars provide navigation systems designed for larger screens with ample space and precise cursor control. These components typically appear as horizontal bars at the top of web applications, featuring dropdown menus, mega menus, or expandable panels. Desktop menu bars can accommodate more options and visual complexity than their mobile counterparts, with hover states, animations, and multilevel navigation that leverages the advantages of desktop interaction patterns.
