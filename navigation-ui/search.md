## Overview

Search components allow users to find content within an application by entering keywords or phrases. These components typically include a search input field, often accompanied by a search icon or button, and may incorporate features like auto-suggestions, search history, or filtering options. Effective search interfaces provide clear visual focus for the input field, responsive feedback as users type, and efficient presentation of search results to help users quickly find what they're looking for.
