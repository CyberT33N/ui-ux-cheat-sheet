## Overview

Send buttons are UI components that trigger the submission of content, typically in messaging, email, or form interfaces. These buttons often include animations like paper planes or sending indicators to provide visual feedback when clicked. Effective send buttons use clear iconography, appropriate colors, and subtle animations to confirm that a message or form has been successfully sent.
