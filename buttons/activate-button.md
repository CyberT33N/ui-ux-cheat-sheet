## Overview

Activate buttons are specialized UI components designed to enable features, start processes, or turn on functionality within applications. These buttons often include toggle animations or state changes to visually indicate activation. Effective activate buttons clearly communicate the action being taken and provide immediate visual feedback about the new state, using color, position, or animation to confirm successful activation.
