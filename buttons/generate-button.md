## Overview

Generate buttons are specialized UI components designed to trigger content or data generation processes, commonly used in AI applications, report creation, or code generation tools. These buttons often incorporate loading states, progress indicators, or success animations to provide feedback during potentially time-consuming generation processes. Effective generate buttons clearly communicate their purpose, provide visual feedback during processing, and indicate completion when the generation task is finished.
