## Overview

Dark/light mode toggles are specialized UI components that allow users to switch between light and dark color themes in applications. These toggles often use sun/moon iconography and smooth animations to visually represent the theme change. Effective dark/light mode toggles provide clear visual feedback about the current theme, smooth transitions between states, and intuitive icons that help users understand the component's purpose without explicit labels.
