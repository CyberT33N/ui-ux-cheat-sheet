## Overview

Play buttons are UI components used to initiate audio or video playback in media players. These buttons typically use the universally recognized "play" triangle icon, often with hover animations or transitions to enhance interactivity. Effective play buttons are easily identifiable, provide clear visual feedback on interaction, and may transform into pause buttons once playback begins to indicate the current state of the media.
