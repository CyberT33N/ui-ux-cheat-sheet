## Overview

Upload buttons are UI components that initiate file upload processes in web applications. These components often include progress indicators, file type icons, and animations to provide visual feedback during the upload process. Effective upload buttons clearly communicate their purpose, support various states (idle, uploading, complete, error), and provide users with feedback about upload progress and status.
