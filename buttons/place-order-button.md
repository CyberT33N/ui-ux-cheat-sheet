## Overview

Place Order buttons are crucial UI components in e-commerce checkout flows that finalize the purchase process. These buttons often include animations or transitions to provide visual feedback when clicked, such as shipping trucks or package delivery animations. Effective Place Order buttons stand out visually from other page elements, clearly communicate their purpose as the final step in checkout, and provide appropriate feedback to confirm order placement.
