## Overview

Switches and toggles are UI components that allow users to quickly turn settings on or off or toggle between two states. Unlike checkboxes, which are typically used in forms, toggles are often used for immediate actions like enabling dark mode or turning on notifications. These components usually provide clear visual differentiation between states, often with sliding animations, color changes, and sometimes accompanying labels to indicate the current state.
