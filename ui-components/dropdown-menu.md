## Overview

Dropdown menus reveal additional options or content when triggered, typically by clicking or hovering over a parent element. These UI components save space by hiding less frequently used options until needed, making interfaces cleaner and more focused. Effective dropdown menus maintain usability through appropriate timing, positioning to avoid overflow issues, clear visual feedback for interactive states, and thoughtful organization of options to help users quickly find what they need.
