## Overview

Hierarchical views organize and display content in a nested, parent-child structure that visually represents relationships between items. These components, commonly implemented as tree views or expandable/collapsible menus, allow users to navigate complex data structures efficiently. Effective hierarchical views use consistent indentation, clear expand/collapse indicators, and intuitive interactions to help users understand and navigate multi-level information architectures like file systems, organizational charts, or category taxonomies.
