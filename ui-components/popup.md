## Overview

Popups are UI components that appear temporarily over the main content to display information, gather input, or prompt user actions. These components include modals, tooltips, dialogs, and notification banners, each serving different purposes in user interactions. Effective popups use appropriate timing, positioning, and dismissal mechanisms to provide important information without disrupting the user experience, balancing visibility with respect for the user's current task and attention.
