## Overview

Scrolling text and marquee components display content in a horizontally moving stream, often used for announcements, news tickers, or showcasing multiple items in a limited space. These elements create visual interest through continuous motion, drawing attention to important information. Modern implementations use CSS animations or JavaScript rather than the deprecated HTML marquee element, offering better performance, accessibility, and control over speed, direction, and pause behavior on interaction.
