## Overview

Pricing and plan components display product or service tiers with their features and costs, helping users compare options and select the best fit for their needs. These components typically present multiple plans side-by-side in a table or card format, highlighting differences and often emphasizing a recommended option. Effective pricing displays use clear visual hierarchy, concise feature descriptions, and strategic highlighting to guide users toward appropriate choices while presenting pricing information transparently.
