## Overview

Video components incorporate video content into web interfaces, whether as background elements, featured content, or interactive players. These components provide playback controls, responsive sizing, and often include features like autoplay options, mute toggles, and fullscreen capabilities. Effective video implementations balance quality with performance concerns, offer appropriate fallbacks for different browser capabilities, and integrate seamlessly with surrounding content for a cohesive user experience.
