## Overview

Success and error message components provide feedback to users about the outcome of their actions. These notification systems use consistent visual language—typically green for success and red for errors—along with appropriate icons and clear messaging to communicate outcomes. Effective feedback systems maintain a consistent style while differentiating between positive and negative states, helping users quickly understand results and take appropriate follow-up actions when needed.
