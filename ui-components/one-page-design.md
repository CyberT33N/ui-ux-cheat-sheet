## Overview

One-page designs present all essential content on a single, scrollable page rather than distributing it across multiple pages. These designs typically use sections, smooth scrolling, and navigation that jumps to different page areas rather than loading new pages. One-page layouts are particularly effective for portfolios, product landing pages, and content with a clear narrative flow, offering a cohesive user experience that eliminates page loading delays and simplifies navigation for focused content consumption.
