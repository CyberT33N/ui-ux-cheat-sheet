## Overview

Badge cards incorporate visual indicators or tags to highlight status, categories, or special features of content. These components typically place badges in the corner or at the top of cards to show information like "New," "Featured," "Sale," or status indicators. Badge cards are particularly effective for e-commerce product listings, content filtering, and emphasizing special or limited-time offers in a clean, visually appealing way.
