## Overview

Multi-layer cards enhance traditional card designs by introducing depth and layering effects. These components stack multiple elements to create a sense of hierarchy and visual interest. Particularly effective for highlighting premium content or important information, multi-layer cards can incorporate hover effects, 3D transformations, and dynamic interactions to create engaging user experiences.
