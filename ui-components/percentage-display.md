## Overview

Percentage display components visually represent numerical percentages, commonly used in dashboards, analytics, and progress tracking. These components take many forms, including circular progress indicators, radial gauges, and horizontal/vertical progress bars. Effective percentage displays provide clear visual indication of the current value, often with animations that help users understand changes in values or completion status, making data more intuitive and engaging than simple numerical representation.
