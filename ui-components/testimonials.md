## Overview

Testimonial components display customer or user feedback to build trust and credibility. These elements typically include a quote, the reviewer's name, and often their photo, title, or company. Testimonials can be presented as static cards, rotating carousels, or grids, depending on the quantity and prominence desired. Effective testimonial displays highlight authentic, specific feedback that addresses potential customer concerns, presented in a visually appealing format that draws attention without overwhelming other page content.
