## Overview

Product tours guide new users through an application's features and functionality, helping them understand how to use the product effectively. These components typically consist of a series of tooltips, modals, or highlighting elements that focus attention on specific UI elements while providing explanatory text. Effective product tours are concise, interactive, and allow users to skip or exit the tour at any point, balancing comprehensive guidance with respect for user autonomy and different learning preferences.
