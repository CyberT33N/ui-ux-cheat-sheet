## Overview

Password update components allow users to change their existing passwords securely. These interfaces typically include fields for the current password (verification) and the new password (with confirmation). Similar to password creation components, update interfaces should include password strength indicators and validation feedback. Effective password update components maintain security through proper verification, provide clear success/error messages, and may offer additional security options like multi-factor authentication triggers for sensitive password changes.
