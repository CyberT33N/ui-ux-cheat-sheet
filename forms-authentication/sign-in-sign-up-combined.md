## Overview

Combined sign-in and sign-up components integrate both authentication processes into a unified interface, typically through tabbed layouts or toggle mechanisms. These interfaces streamline the authentication experience by presenting both options within the same modal or page section, reducing navigation steps for users. Effective combined authentication components maintain clear visual distinction between the two processes while sharing a consistent design language, simplifying the user experience without sacrificing functionality or security.
