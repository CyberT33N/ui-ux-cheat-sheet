## Overview

Password creation components guide users through establishing secure passwords for their accounts. These interfaces typically include input fields with masking options, strength indicators, and real-time validation feedback based on password requirements. Effective password creation components balance security requirements with usability, providing clear guidance on password criteria, visual feedback on strength, and confirmation fields to prevent input errors, all while maintaining appropriate security practices like not transmitting plaintext passwords.
