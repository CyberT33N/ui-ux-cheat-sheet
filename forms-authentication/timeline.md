## Overview

Timeline components visually represent events in chronological sequence, using a linear arrangement with dates, labels, and often icons or images. These visualizations are valuable for displaying project histories, company milestones, product development stages, or historical information. Effective timeline implementations use clear visual indicators for progression, appropriate spacing for temporal relationships, and responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining chronological clarity.
