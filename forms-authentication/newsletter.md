## Overview

Newsletter components enable users to subscribe to regular content updates via email. These forms typically include a minimal input field for email addresses, often with additional optional fields for personalization. Effective newsletter components balance simplicity with clear value propositions, include appropriate validation for email formats, provide clear feedback on submission, and may incorporate GDPR/privacy compliance elements like consent checkboxes or links to privacy policies.
