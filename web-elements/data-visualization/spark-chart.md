## Overview

Spark charts are miniature, word-sized data visualizations designed to be embedded within text or tables. These compact charts show trends, patterns, or variations in data without requiring the space of full-sized charts. Spark charts are particularly useful in dashboards, reports, and data-dense interfaces where space is limited but quick visual insights are valuable. Despite their small size, they effectively communicate data patterns at a glance, complementing rather than replacing numerical values.
