## Overview

Line charts are fundamental data visualization components that display information as a series of data points connected by straight lines. These charts excel at showing trends over continuous time periods and demonstrating how values change. Line charts are particularly effective for visualizing temporal data like stock prices, temperature changes, sales trends, or any metric where understanding the pattern of change over time is important. Multiple lines can be displayed on the same chart to enable comparison between different data series.
