## Overview

Progress bars visually represent completion status or progress toward a goal using a filled horizontal bar. These simple yet effective components provide immediate visual feedback about the current state of a process, download, upload, or goal achievement. Progress bars can be styled in various ways with different colors, animations, and text indicators to enhance user understanding and engagement with processes that take time to complete.
