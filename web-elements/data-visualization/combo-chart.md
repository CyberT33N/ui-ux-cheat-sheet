## Overview

Combo charts combine multiple visualization types (like bars, lines, and areas) into a single chart, allowing for more complex data representation. These versatile charts are particularly useful for displaying relationships between different data series that may be best represented using different chart types. By combining visual elements, combo charts can effectively show correlations, trends, and comparisons in a unified view, making them valuable for comprehensive data analysis.
