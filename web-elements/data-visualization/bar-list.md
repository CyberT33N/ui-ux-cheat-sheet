## Overview

Bar lists combine text labels with horizontal bars to create ranked or comparative displays. These components are excellent for showing relative values in a compact, scannable format. Unlike traditional bar charts, bar lists typically integrate text descriptions directly alongside the visual bars, making them more informative at a glance. They're particularly useful for leaderboards, rankings, and displaying progress or performance metrics across multiple categories or items.
