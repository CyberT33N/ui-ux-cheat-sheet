## Overview

Progress circles, also known as circular progress bars or radial progress indicators, display completion status or progress using a circular arc. These components present percentage-based progress in a compact, visually appealing format that works well in dashboards, profile completeness indicators, and goal tracking. Progress circles can be customized with different colors, animations, and center content to convey additional information while maintaining their space-efficient circular design.
