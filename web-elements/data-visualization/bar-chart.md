## Overview

Bar charts are essential data visualization components that represent data using rectangular bars, where the length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents. They are ideal for comparing quantities across different categories and displaying changes over time. Bar charts work well for showing discrete data and can be oriented horizontally or vertically depending on the use case and space constraints.
