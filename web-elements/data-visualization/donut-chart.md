## Overview

Donut charts are circular visualizations with a hole in the center, used to display proportional data. Similar to pie charts but with an empty center that can contain additional information, donut charts show how parts relate to a whole through proportionally sized segments. They're particularly useful for displaying simple percentage breakdowns, portfolio allocation, or survey results where the focus is on part-to-whole relationships rather than precise comparisons between segments.
