## Overview

Category bars are specialized visualization components that display proportional data within defined categories. These components use segmented horizontal bars to show how different parts contribute to a whole, with each segment color-coded to represent different categories. Category bars excel at showing the composition of data and are particularly effective for displaying budget allocations, market share breakdowns, or any scenario where understanding the relative proportion of categories is important.
