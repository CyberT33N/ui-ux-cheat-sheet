## Overview

Canvas backgrounds use the HTML5 Canvas API to create dynamic, animated backgrounds through JavaScript. These backgrounds offer more flexibility and interaction possibilities than CSS-only approaches, including particle systems, generative art, and responsive animations that react to user input. While not as performance-intensive as WebGL, canvas backgrounds still require consideration of rendering efficiency, particularly for complex animations on lower-powered devices.
