## Overview

Code comparison components visually highlight differences between code snippets, making it easier to identify changes, additions, or deletions. These components are essential for documentation of code changes, tutorials demonstrating before/after scenarios, or collaboration tools where code reviews take place. Effective code comparison displays use color coding, line numbers, and clear visual separation to help users quickly understand the nature and scope of differences between code versions.
