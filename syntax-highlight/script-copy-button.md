## Overview

Script copy buttons enhance code blocks by providing a one-click solution for copying code to the clipboard. These components improve developer experience in documentation, tutorials, and code-sharing platforms by eliminating the need to manually select text. Effective script copy buttons provide clear visual affordance for their purpose, offer feedback when clicked (such as a checkmark or "Copied!" message), and handle copying operations with proper fallbacks for browser compatibility.
