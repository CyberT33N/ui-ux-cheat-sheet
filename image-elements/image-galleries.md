## Overview

Image galleries organize and display collections of images in grid, masonry, or other structured layouts. These components enable users to browse multiple images simultaneously and often include filtering, sorting, or search functionality for larger collections. Many image galleries also integrate with lightbox components for enlarged viewing. Effective galleries balance thumbnail size and density to provide sufficient visual information while enabling efficient browsing through potentially large image collections.
