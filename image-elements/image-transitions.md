## Overview

Image transition effects create smooth, visually appealing movements between images or states of an image. These effects include fades, slides, zooms, and more creative transitions like page flips or morphing. Transition effects can enhance user experience when moving between content, drawing attention to new information, or providing visual feedback for interactions. Effective image transitions balance visual interest with performance considerations, using appropriate timing and easing functions to avoid distracting or disorienting users.
