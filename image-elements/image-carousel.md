## Overview

Image carousels, also known as sliders, display a series of images in a rotating sequence, allowing users to browse multiple images within a limited space. These components typically include navigation controls (arrows, dots, or thumbnails) and can feature various transition effects between slides. Effective image carousels balance visual appeal with usability, offering appropriate timing, intuitive controls, and responsive behavior across different screen sizes.
